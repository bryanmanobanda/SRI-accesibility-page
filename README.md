## ðŸ–‹ Reflection

The primary objective of the redesign was to **improve the vehicle payment report module**, focusing on **usability, accessibility, and responsive design**.

The process began with a **detailed evaluation** of the original interface using **UXCheck, SortSite, WAVE, and AChecker** to identify usability and accessibility flaws. Further analysis was conducted using **Nielsenâ€™s Heuristics, WCAG 2.2 Guidelines, and SUS Evaluations** to pinpoint critical areas for improvement.

Next, **Figma prototypes** for both **web** ([View prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/iztFpm2SffeXmDQFJXrTPD/Prototipo---SRI?node-id=61-79&p=f&t=gPXpXOtQsfFaUVIB-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1)) and **mobile** ([View prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/iztFpm2SffeXmDQFJXrTPD/Prototipo---SRI?node-id=72-245&p=f&t=P4Tie8GQe28YZcFW-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=24%3A19&starting-point-node-id=72%3A245)) were created to refine the design before implementation in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The final redesign introduced **improvements in keyboard navigation, table navigation, information visibility, site architecture, and overall accessibility**, resolving previous usability issues. A post-development reassessment using the same tools and methodologies showed a **6.85% increase in usability scores**, confirming a more efficient and user-friendly experience.
